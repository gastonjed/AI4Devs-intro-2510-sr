# Prompts & Chatbot Used

- **Chatbot:** ChatGPT (GPT-5 Thinking)
- **Date:** 2025-11-03
- **Repo / Exercise:** AI4Devs-intro-2510-sr — Reverse String

## Prompt 1

```
I have a project with a certain file structure and I need to use it to create a reverse string app on javascript regarding certain requirements.

Do it considering:
- minimal and simplest implementation to achieve the solution
- follow strong coding practices
- include useful (but minimal) documentation

# Reverse string EN

Create a **web page with JavaScript logic that reverses the order of a string**.

Example: if I input `AI4Devs`, it should return `sveD4IA`.

Do it using the seed files `index.html` and `script.js` provided in the template folder.

Use a chatbot like ChatGPT or Gemini, not a code assistant in an IDE like Github Copilot.

To submit, make a pull request that includes a folder copied from the template, named `reversestring-initials` (for example, `reversestring-ARM`). It must include not only the generated code but also, importantly, **the prompt used and the chatbot utilized** in `prompts.md`. If you used more than one prompt to reach a suitable solution, include them all in order. Also, include the final prompt in the pull request comment.

## Prompt 2

Implement the following additional feature:
- The button should appear only when there is enough text, more than 3 letters


### Prompt 3

```
implement the following additional feature:
- show the output string in real time, do not depend on the button

give me the full code for each file so I can do a drop-in replacement
```

### Prompt 4

```
the reverse button now does not make any sense. Please, remove it completelly
